/**
 * Initializes a new verifier router program instance on Solana
 *
 * Creates and initializes a Program Derived Address (PDA) that will serve as the router
 * account for managing verifier programs. The router is initialized with the provided
 * owner as the authority who can add verifiers and perform administrative operations.
 *
 * The initialization includes:
 * - Creating a router PDA with seeds = [b"router"]
 * - Setting up initial ownership configuration
 * - Initializing verifier count to 0
 *
 * @param {Rpc<SolanaRpcApi>} rpc - RPC connection to Solana
 * @param {RpcSubscriptions<SolanaRpcSubscriptionsApi>} rpcSubscriptions - WebSocket connection for transaction confirmation
 * @param {Address<string>} routerAddress - Address of the verifier router program to initialize
 * @param {TransactionSigner} owner - The account that will be set as the initial owner
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when initialization is confirmed on-chain
 * @throws If PDA creation fails or if the initialization transaction fails
 *
 * @security This sets up critical program state and ownership - ensure owner address is correct
 * @notice Only needs to be called once when deploying a new router program
 * @warn Will fail if program has been initialized before
