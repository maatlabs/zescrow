# Local Development Demos

These tutorials guide you through running Zescrow on **local test networks** for development and testing purposes.

For **devnet/testnet deployment**, see the [Deployment Guide](/deploy/README.md).

## Available Demos

- [Solana Demo](solana_demo.md) - End-to-end escrow on local Solana test validator
- [Ethereum Demo](ethereum_demo.md) - End-to-end escrow on local Hardhat node

## When to Use These Demos

Use these local demos when:

- Learning how Zescrow works
- Developing new features
- Running integration tests
- Debugging issues

For real-world usage on testnets, use the deployment scripts in `/deploy/`.
